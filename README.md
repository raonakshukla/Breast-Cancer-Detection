# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Breast Cancer is the most frequent kind of cancer a large number of women are affected by it. Any development in early prediction can significantly affect the treatment aspect and survival of the patient. The main objective of this paper is to use different machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Gradient Boost, and Random Forest to classify patients and estimate their survival time. The steps taken in the study are data preparation, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, tuning of the base model, and ensemble learning. For classification, our ensemble model got a balanced classification accuracy of 0.681 and for regression a mean absolute error for relapse-free survival time of around 12.637 weeks.
